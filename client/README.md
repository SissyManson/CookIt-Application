<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Cook It! is a web application that allows logged in users to view, create, edit and delete recipes. Users that are not logged in can only view the recipes. In order to get more functionality they must either create an account or log in in an existing one!

For the back-end is used SoftUni's server that has been modified to fit the current app.
